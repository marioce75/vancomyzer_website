# Vancomyzer Web Application Test Results

## User Problem Statement
The user requested completion of the "vancomyzer" application. Initially, this involved completing a Swift/iOS application, which was successfully done. Subsequently, the user requested a web version of the application with interactive graphics to show AUC (Area Under Curve) calculations as numbers are modified.

## Current Application Status
- **Backend**: FastAPI server running on port 8001 with MongoDB integration
- **Frontend**: React application running on port 3000 (currently simplified version)
- **Database**: MongoDB running locally

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent to test API endpoints
- Test `/api/health` endpoint for basic connectivity
- Test `/api/calculate-dosing` endpoint for core functionality
- Test `/api/pk-simulation` endpoint for PK curve generation
- Test `/api/bayesian-optimization` endpoint for advanced calculations
- Verify data validation and error handling

### Frontend Testing
- Only test frontend after explicit user permission
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI testing
- Test patient input form functionality
- Test real-time calculation features
- Verify AUC visualization components

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Address any issues found during testing
- Prioritize functional requirements over cosmetic issues
- Ensure core vancomycin dosing calculations work correctly

## Test Results Summary

### Backend Tests
Status: **COMPLETED** - All core endpoints tested successfully

**Test Results (7/7 passed - 100% success rate):**
- ✅ Health Check: API health endpoint working correctly
- ✅ Calculate Dosing: Core vancomycin dosing calculations functional
- ✅ PK Simulation: Pharmacokinetic curve generation working
- ✅ Bayesian Optimization: Advanced Bayesian calculations functional
- ✅ Data Validation: Input validation and error handling working
- ✅ Patient Scenarios: Multiple patient types (adult, pediatric) supported
- ✅ WebSocket Connectivity: Real-time calculation endpoint available

**Key Findings:**
- All API endpoints respond correctly with expected data structures
- Dosing calculations produce clinically appropriate results
- Data validation properly rejects invalid inputs
- Multiple patient populations supported (adult, pediatric, neonatal)
- PK curve data generated for visualization
- Bayesian optimization working with measured drug levels

### Frontend Tests
Status: **BASIC FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED**
- Minimal React app loads successfully
- Basic interactivity working (button clicks, state updates)
- Complex visualization components temporarily simplified due to memory issues
- Need user permission before comprehensive frontend testing

## Known Issues
1. **Memory Issues**: Original complex visualization components (Plotly.js, Chart.js) caused Node.js heap memory errors
2. **Solution Applied**: Increased Node.js heap limit to 4096MB via NODE_OPTIONS
3. **Current Workaround**: Using simplified components until stability confirmed

## Backend API Endpoints Verified
- `GET /api/health` - Returns system health status
- `POST /api/calculate-dosing` - Core vancomycin dosing calculations
- `POST /api/pk-simulation` - PK curve simulation with dose/interval parameters
- `POST /api/bayesian-optimization` - Bayesian optimization with measured levels
- `WebSocket /ws/realtime-calc` - Real-time calculation updates

## Next Steps
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Test backend API endpoints using deep_testing_backend_v2
2. Ask user permission for frontend testing
3. Gradually restore complex visualization features
4. Ensure AUC interactive graphics work as requested
