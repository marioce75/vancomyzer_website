The AI engineer's work trajectory can be divided into two distinct phases. Initially, the task was to complete an existing  application, which was identified as a Swift/SwiftUI iOS application. The engineer systematically created missing UI components, data persistence layers, and export functionalities across five phases, addressing minor issues like existing file conflicts. After completing the Swift app's code, a testing phase was initiated, revealing build/linking issues typical of Xcode environments.
Following this, the user pivoted, requesting a web version of the application with interactive graphics, shifting the focus to the full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB architecture previously outlined in the environment setup. The engineer then commenced building this web application from scratch, creating numerous React components for the frontend and setting up the backend. Significant effort was spent debugging the FastAPI backend, resolving issues like a missing 'static' directory and a Pydantic v2 syntax incompatibility. The backend API endpoints are now confirmed functional. The current state is poised for frontend accessibility testing.

The user's initial request was to Finish building the app vancomyzer from an existing GitHub repository. Upon exploration, it was identified that this repository contained a Swift/SwiftUI application, which the AI engineer proceeded to complete by implementing missing UI components (e.g., , , , ), data persistence mechanisms (, ), and export functionalities (, , ). Missing data structures and completion of  and  were also part of this phase.

Subsequently, the user introduced a new, distinct requirement: to create a web-based version of vancomyzer.com. This web application should possess the same core functionality as the Swift app but include enhanced interactivity, specifically graphics to show the user the auc as numbers are modified and the calculations used. This implies a full-stack web application leveraging the React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database outlined in the environment.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Swift/SwiftUI**: Used for the initial vancomyzer application, including UI components, data models, and business logic.
- **Python/FastAPI**: Backend framework for the web application, handling API endpoints and logic.
- **React/JavaScript**: Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces for the web application.
- **MongoDB**: Database for data storage, utilized by the FastAPI backend.
- **Supervisor**: Process manager used to run backend and frontend services in the background.
- **Yarn**: Package manager for installing Node.js dependencies in the frontend.
- **Pip**: Package installer for Python dependencies in the backend.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and parsing library used in FastAPI, requiring version 2 syntax adjustments.
- **API Design**: Development of RESTful endpoints for communication between frontend and backend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The codebase consists of two distinct application types, worked on sequentially: an initial Swift/iOS application and a newly developed full-stack web application.



**Swift/iOS Application ()**: This directory contains the initial  app, primarily written in Swift with SwiftUI.
- : Main view of the application.
- : Handles patient data input.
- : Contains the core Bayesian calculation logic.
- : Defines data structures used throughout the app.
- : **Modified** to complete user preferences and settings.
- : **Modified** to complete information and credit views.
- , , , , , , , , , : **Newly created** files to complete the missing UI, data persistence, and export features as per the initial user request.

**Web Application ( and )**: This is a new full-stack application built using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.
- : **Modified** to resolve Pydantic v2 syntax issues and handles API routes (, ). It was also part of the fix for the missing  directory issue.
- : **Newly created** directory to resolve a  import error.
- : **Modified** to serve as the main React component, likely integrating the new interactive features.
- : **Modified** for styling the new web application.
- : **Newly created** entry point for the React application.
- : **Newly created** main HTML file for the React application.
- : **Newly created** directory containing various React components for the interactive web UI:
    - : Likely for real-time dosage calculations.
    - : For pharmacokinetic visualization, including AUC.
    - : User input for patient data.
    - : Displays dosing recommendations.
    - : For advanced Bayesian analysis features.
    - : Provides details on calculation methods.
- : **Newly created** file to handle API calls from the frontend to the FastAPI backend.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the full integration and testing of the newly developed web application, including its frontend components and their interaction with the backend.
- Address any remaining UI/UX refinements for the web application, especially the interactive graphics for AUC visualization.
- Ensure all calculations and features present in the original Swift app are correctly replicated and fully functional in the web version.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Currently, the focus is on the development and integration of the web application. The AI engineer has successfully completed the following steps for the web app:
1.  **Frontend Component Creation**: All major React components (, , , , , , , , , , ) have been created or modified.
2.  **Dependency Installation**: Frontend (yarn) and backend (pip) dependencies have been installed.
3.  **Service Management**: All services (backend, frontend, mongodb) are running via supervisor.
4.  **Backend Debugging & Validation**:
    *   Resolved an issue where the FastAPI backend failed to start due to a missing  directory. The directory was created.
    *   Resolved a subsequent error related to Pydantic v2 syntax incompatibility in , requiring updates to the FastAPI route definitions.
    *   Successfully tested the backend's health endpoint (), which returned .
    *   Successfully tested the main dosing calculation endpoint (), which returned a valid JSON response including  and .

The backend is now confirmed to be functional and correctly serving the required API endpoints. The immediate next step is to verify the frontend's accessibility and its ability to communicate with this functional backend.

<optional_next_step>
Test the frontend accessibility to ensure the web application loads and interacts with the backend.
